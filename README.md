# 62k-crystals
Post-analysis of 62k molecular dataset

## Objectives

* Objective 1: Reproduce the machine learning results from the paper
* Objective: Predict energy levels based on smile strings.
* Objective 3: Predict the change in energy level from all occupy to unoccupied.
* Objective 4: Determined if there are any, between the elements, no of molecules and no of bonds and column 5 and column 22
* Objective 5: Predict the effects of single substitution of atoms on all the measured data, double substitution, central atom â€¦
* Objective 6: Predict the effects of the percentage composition on the all the energy levels. 5-26
* Objective 7: Predict row 5 effects on 9-12, 17-20 and 25, 26, (structure on orbitals).
